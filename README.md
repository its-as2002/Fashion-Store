# Fashion-Store

The FASHION STORE project in C++ is a simple console application
built with the use of graphics. This project works on the basis of online
shopping of clothes of all types for mens,womens and kids. This project
helps in managing the record of all orders on the basis of their Order Idâ€™s.
In this project we tried to enter all details of order and customer like cloth
name,brand, customer name,address,mobile no. etc and tried to maintain
all the possibility which may help the user to operate this program with
more efficiency. Some of the features of the program are:

order details.

**2.View Orders:** This features helps us to view all orders present in binary
file.
